Support kitty development
===========================

My goal with |kitty| is to move the stagnant terminal ecosystem forward.  To that
end kitty has many foundational features, such as: :doc:`image support
<graphics-protocol>`, :doc:`superlative performance <performance>`,
:doc:`various enhancements to the terminal protocol <protocol-extensions>`,
etc. These features allow the development of rich terminal applications, such
as :doc:`Side-by-side diff <kittens/diff>`, :doc:`Unicode input
<kittens/unicode-input>`, etc.

If you wish to support this mission and see the terminal ecosystem evolve,
consider donating so that I can devote more time to |kitty| development.
I have personally written `almost all kitty code
<https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/graphs/contributors>`_.

You can use the `Patreon <https://www.patreon.com/kovidgoyal>`_ or `Liberapay
<https://liberapay.com/kovidgoyal/donate>`_ services to support my kitty
development.
