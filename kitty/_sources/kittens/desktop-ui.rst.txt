Power users of terminals on Linux also often like to use bare bones window
managers instead of full fledged desktop environments. This kitten helps
provide parts of the desktop environment that are missing from such setups,
and does so using keyboard friendly, terminal first UI components. Some of its
features are:

  * Replace the typical File Open/Save dialogs used in GUI programs with the
    fast and keyboard centric :doc:`choose-files </kittens/choose-files>` kitten
    running in a semi-transparent kitty overlay.

  * Allow simple command line based management of the desktop light/dark modes.
