Hints
==========

|kitty| has a *hints mode* to select and act on arbitrary text snippets currently
visible on the screen.  For example, you can press |sc_kitten_hints|
to choose any URL visible on the screen and then open it using your system
browser.

Similarly, you can press |sc_kitten_hints_type_path_program| to
select anything that looks like a path or filename and then insert it into the
terminal, very useful for picking files from the output of a ``git`` or ``ls`` command and
adding them to the command line for the next command.
