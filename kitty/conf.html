<h1>Configuring kitty<a class="headerlink" href="#configuring-kitty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>kitty</em> is highly customizable, everything from keyboard shortcuts, to painting
frames-per-second. See the heavily commented default config file below for an
overview of all customization possibilities.</p>
<p>You can open the config file within kitty by pressing <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">ctrl+shift+f2</kbd>.
You can also display the current configuration by running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kitty</span>
<span class="pre">--debug-config</span></code>.</p>
<div class="highlight-ini notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># vim:fileencoding=utf-8:ft=conf</span>

<span class="c1"># You can include secondary config files via the &quot;include&quot; directive.</span>
<span class="c1"># If you use a relative path for include, it is resolved with respect to the</span>
<span class="c1"># location of the current config file. Note that environment variables</span>
<span class="c1"># are expanded, so ${USER}.conf becomes name.conf if USER=name</span>
<span class="c1"># For example:</span>
<span class="c1"># include other.conf</span>

<span class="c1"># Fonts {{{</span>
<span class="c1"># Font family. You can also specify different fonts for the</span>
<span class="c1"># bold/italic/bold-italic variants. By default they are derived automatically,</span>
<span class="c1"># by the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font families</span>
<span class="c1"># that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example:</span>
<span class="c1"># font_family Operator Mono Book</span>
<span class="c1"># bold_font Operator Mono Medium</span>
<span class="c1"># italic_font Operator Mono Book Italic</span>
<span class="c1"># bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># You can get a list of full family names available on your computer by running</span>
<span class="c1"># kitty list-fonts</span>
<span class="c1"># The default values shown below rely on your OS to choose an appropriate monospace font family.</span>
<span class="na">font_family      monospace</span>
<span class="na">italic_font      auto</span>
<span class="na">bold_font        auto</span>
<span class="na">bold_italic_font auto</span>

<span class="c1"># Font size (in pts)</span>
<span class="na">font_size        11.0</span>

<span class="c1"># Adjust the cell dimensions.</span>
<span class="c1"># You can use either numbers, which are interpreted as pixels or percentages</span>
<span class="c1"># (number followed by %), which are interpreted as percentages of the</span>
<span class="c1"># unmodified values. You can use negative pixels or percentages less than</span>
<span class="c1"># 100% to reduce sizes (but this might cause rendering artifacts).</span>
<span class="na">adjust_line_height 0</span>
<span class="na">adjust_column_width 0</span>

<span class="c1"># Symbol mapping (special font for specified unicode code points). Map the</span>
<span class="c1"># specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful if you need special</span>
<span class="c1"># rendering for some symbols, such as for Powerline. Avoids the need for</span>
<span class="c1"># patched fonts. Each unicode code point is specified in the form U+&lt;code point</span>
<span class="c1"># in hexadecimal&gt;. You can specify multiple code points, separated by commas</span>
<span class="c1"># and ranges separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple times.</span>
<span class="c1"># Syntax is:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># For example:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A2,U+E0B0-U+E0B3 PowerlineSymbols</span>

<span class="c1"># Change the sizes of the lines used for the box drawing unicode characters</span>
<span class="c1"># These values are in pts. They will be scaled by the monitor DPI to arrive at</span>
<span class="c1"># a pixel value. There must be four values corresponding to thin, normal, thick,</span>
<span class="c1"># and very thick lines;</span>
<span class="na">box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2</span>
<span class="c1"># }}}</span>


<span class="c1"># Cursor customization {{{</span>
<span class="c1"># The cursor color</span>
<span class="na">cursor           #cccccc</span>

<span class="c1"># The cursor shape can be one of (block, beam, underline)</span>
<span class="na">cursor_shape     block</span>

<span class="c1"># The interval (in seconds) at which to blink the cursor. Set to zero to</span>
<span class="c1"># disable blinking. Note that numbers smaller than repaint_delay will be</span>
<span class="c1"># limited to repaint_delay.</span>
<span class="na">cursor_blink_interval     0.5</span>

<span class="c1"># Stop blinking cursor after the specified number of seconds of keyboard inactivity. Set to</span>
<span class="c1"># zero to never stop blinking.</span>
<span class="na">cursor_stop_blinking_after 15.0</span>
<span class="c1"># }}}</span>


<span class="c1"># Scrollback {{{</span>
<span class="c1"># Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back</span>
<span class="na">scrollback_lines 2000</span>

<span class="c1"># Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The scrollback buffer is passed as</span>
<span class="c1"># STDIN to this program. If you change it, make sure the program you use can</span>
<span class="c1"># handle ANSI escape sequences for colors and text formatting.</span>
<span class="na">scrollback_pager less +G -R</span>

<span class="c1"># Wheel scroll multiplier (modify the amount scrolled by the mouse wheel). Use negative</span>
<span class="c1"># numbers to change scroll direction.</span>
<span class="na">wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0</span>
<span class="c1"># }}}</span>


<span class="c1"># Mouse {{{</span>
<span class="c1"># The color and style for highlighting URLs on mouse-over. url_style can be one of:</span>
<span class="c1"># none, single, double, curly</span>
<span class="na">url_color #0087BD</span>
<span class="na">url_style curly</span>

<span class="c1"># The modifier keys to press when clicking with the mouse on URLs to open the URL</span>
<span class="na">open_url_modifiers kitty_mod</span>

<span class="c1"># The program with which to open URLs that are clicked on. The special value &quot;default&quot; means to</span>
<span class="c1"># use the operating system&#39;s default URL handler.</span>
<span class="na">open_url_with default</span>

<span class="c1"># Copy to clipboard on select. With this enabled, simply selecting text with</span>
<span class="c1"># the mouse will cause the text to be copied to clipboard. Useful on platforms</span>
<span class="c1"># such as macOS/Wayland that do not have the concept of primary selections. Note</span>
<span class="c1"># that this is a security risk, as all programs, including websites open in your</span>
<span class="c1"># browser can read the contents of the clipboard.</span>
<span class="na">copy_on_select no</span>

<span class="c1"># The modifiers to use rectangular selection (i.e. to select text in a</span>
<span class="c1"># rectangular block with the mouse)</span>
<span class="na">rectangle_select_modifiers ctrl+alt</span>

<span class="c1"># Characters considered part of a word when double clicking. In addition to these characters</span>
<span class="c1"># any character that is marked as an alpha-numeric character in the unicode</span>
<span class="c1"># database will be matched.</span>
<span class="na">select_by_word_characters :@-./_~?&amp;</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">%+#</span>

<span class="c1"># The interval between successive clicks to detect double/triple clicks (in seconds)</span>
<span class="na">click_interval 0.5</span>

<span class="c1"># Hide mouse cursor after the specified number of seconds of the mouse not being used. Set to</span>
<span class="c1"># zero to disable mouse cursor hiding.</span>
<span class="na">mouse_hide_wait 3.0</span>

<span class="c1"># Set the active window to the window under the mouse when moving the mouse around</span>
<span class="na">focus_follows_mouse no</span>
<span class="c1"># }}}</span>


<span class="c1"># Performance tuning {{{</span>
<span class="c1"># Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates. Decreasing it, increases</span>
<span class="c1"># frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage. The default value</span>
<span class="c1"># yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for most uses. Note that to</span>
<span class="c1"># actually achieve 100FPS you have to either set sync_to_monitor to no or use a</span>
<span class="c1"># monitor with a high refresh rate.</span>
<span class="na">repaint_delay    10</span>

<span class="c1"># Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in the terminal</span>
<span class="c1"># is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase responsiveness, but also</span>
<span class="c1"># increase CPU usage and might cause flicker in full screen programs that</span>
<span class="c1"># redraw the entire screen on each loop, because kitty is so fast that partial</span>
<span class="c1"># screen updates will be drawn.</span>
<span class="na">input_delay 3</span>

<span class="c1"># Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This prevents</span>
<span class="c1"># tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing) when scrolling. However,</span>
<span class="c1"># it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of your monitor. With a</span>
<span class="c1"># very high speed mouse/high keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency.</span>
<span class="c1"># If so, set this to no.</span>
<span class="na">sync_to_monitor yes</span>
<span class="c1"># }}}</span>


<span class="c1"># Audio/visual bell {{{</span>
<span class="c1"># Visual bell duration. Flash the screen when a bell occurs for the specified number of</span>
<span class="c1"># seconds. Set to zero to disable.</span>
<span class="na">visual_bell_duration 0.0</span>

<span class="c1"># Enable/disable the audio bell. Useful in environments that require silence.</span>
<span class="na">enable_audio_bell yes</span>

<span class="c1"># Request window attention on bell.</span>
<span class="c1"># Makes the dock icon bounce on macOS or the taskbar flash on linux.</span>
<span class="na">window_alert_on_bell yes</span>

<span class="c1"># Show a bell symbol on the tab if a bell occurs in one of the windows in the</span>

<span class="c1"># }}}</span>


<span class="c1"># Window layout {{{</span>
<span class="c1"># If enabled, the window size will be remembered so that new instances of kitty will have the same</span>
<span class="c1"># size as the previous instance. If disabled, the window will initially have size configured</span>
<span class="c1"># by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a suffix of &quot;c&quot; on the width/height values</span>
<span class="c1"># to have them interpreted as number of cells instead of pixels.</span>
<span class="na">remember_window_size   yes</span>
<span class="na">initial_window_width   640</span>
<span class="na">initial_window_height  400</span>

<span class="c1"># The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names. The special value * means</span>
<span class="c1"># all layouts. The first listed layout will be used as the startup layout.</span>
<span class="c1"># For a list of available layouts, see the README.</span>
<span class="na">enabled_layouts *</span>

<span class="c1"># The step size (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when resizing</span>
<span class="c1"># windows. The cells value is used for horizontal resizing and the lines value</span>
<span class="c1"># for vertical resizing.</span>
<span class="na">window_resize_step_cells 2</span>
<span class="na">window_resize_step_lines 2</span>

<span class="c1"># The width (in pts) of window borders. Will be rounded to the nearest number of pixels based on screen resolution.</span>
<span class="c1"># Note that borders are displayed only when more than one window is visible. They are meant to separate multiple windows.</span>
<span class="na">window_border_width 1</span>

<span class="c1"># The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border)</span>

<span class="c1"># The background color</span>
<span class="na">background       #000000</span>

<span class="c1"># The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is opaque and 0 is fully transparent.</span>
<span class="c1"># This will only work if supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under X11). Note</span>
<span class="c1"># that it only sets the default background color&#39;s opacity. This is so that</span>
<span class="c1"># things like the status bar in vim, powerline prompts, etc. still look good.</span>
<span class="c1"># But it means that if you use a color theme with a background color in your</span>
<span class="c1"># editor, it will not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the</span>
<span class="c1"># default background color in your kitty config and not use a background color</span>
<span class="c1"># in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set the terminals</span>
<span class="c1"># default colors in a shell script to launch your editor.</span>
<span class="c1"># Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly significant) performance hit.</span>
<span class="na">background_opacity 1.0</span>
<span class="c1"># If you want to dynamically change transparency of windows set dynamic_background_opacity to yes</span>

<span class="na">dynamic_background_opacity no</span>

<span class="c1"># How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. 1.0 means no dimming and</span>

<span class="c1"># Advanced {{{</span>

<span class="c1"># The shell program to execute. The default value of . means</span>
<span class="c1"># to use whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user.</span>

<span class="c1"># ensure that the shell starts in interactive mode and reads its startup rc files.</span>
<span class="na">shell .</span>

<span class="c1"># The console editor to use when editing the kitty config file or similar</span>
<span class="c1"># tasks. A value of . means to use the environment variable EDITOR. Note that</span>

<span class="c1"># scripts but system-wide, otherwise kitty will not see it.</span>
<span class="na">editor .</span>

<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># Close the window when the child process (shell) exits. If no (the default),</span>
<span class="c1"># the terminal will remain open when the child exits as long as there are still</span>
<span class="c1"># processes outputting to the terminal (for example disowned or backgrounded</span>
<span class="c1"># processes). If yes, the window will close as soon as the child process exits.</span>
<span class="c1"># Note that setting it to yes means that any background processes still using</span>
<span class="c1"># the terminal can fail silently because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer</span>
<span class="c1"># work.</span>

<span class="c1"># Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on other programs can</span>
<span class="c1"># control all aspects of kitty, including sending text to kitty windows,</span>
<span class="c1"># opening new windows, closing windows, reading the content of windows, etc.</span>

<span class="c1"># This will send &quot;Special text&quot; when you press the Ctrl+Alt+a key combination.</span>
<span class="c1"># The text to be sent is a python string literal so you can use escapes like</span>
<span class="c1"># \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to send unicode characters (or you can</span>
<span class="c1"># just input the unicode characters directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument</span>

<span class="c1"># values are normal or application or kitty or a comma separated combination of them.</span>
<span class="c1"># The special keyword all means all modes. The modes normal and application refer to</span>
<span class="c1"># the DECCKM cursor key mode for terminals, and kitty refers to the special kitty</span>
<span class="c1"># extended keyboard protocol. Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor</span>
